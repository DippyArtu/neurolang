# NeuroLang â€” neural network programming language

**NeuroLang** is a programming specification that allows to use Natural-Language Neural Network models, namely **ChatGPT**, as a virtual computer, built and launched inside the neural network

**NeuroLang** allows the development of complex data analysis and classification systems, combining the power of intent and semantic analysis provided by neural networks with structure and controllable deterministic behavior of classical code. **NeuroLang** dramatically enhances the possibilities of neural network based computations and prompt engineering, by allowing to create not one detailed prompt, but complex systems of prompts with branched flow and "run-time" decision making, full modules and libraries of prompts-as-code

**Neural Virtual Machine** (**NVM**) is a programming environment, "imagined" by the neural network. It keeps it's state in neural net's "memory" and operates not by compiling the source code into a set of instructions that are later sent to the processor, but by "understanding" the code and "imagining" the code flow, the state changes and the outcome

Instead of being translated to a set of machine-instructions, **NVM** will "understand" the code by breaking up the words, that compose the code into a sequence of **tokens**, a combination of which is evaluated and analyzed. Using the massive corpus of knowledge about both natural and programming languages, **NVM** will build a statistical model that will evaluate which **tokens** are most likely to come following the code. In a way, **NVM** **imagines** what would the result of the code's evaluation will be

It is possible to invoke language-specific functions or libraries with **NeuroLang** and the **NVM** will evaluate it. Moreover, since **NVM** itself is **imagined** by the neural model, it is possible to invoke the evaluation of a prompt by the neural network directly

Since **NVM** contains extensive knowledge about most classical programming languages, NeuroLang can be freely used as if it were, for example, Python, or JavaScript, or a combination of these. Moreover, since **NVM** uses "imaginary" processor, it is possible to model the state change caused by some imaginary program and use the result of this imaginary state change in the code. For example, if one needs a data classifier software inside the code, or a blockchain Smart-Contract, or a signal analyzer, he doesn't actually has to code it â€” one can simply make **NeuroLang** **imagine** it

For example, it is possible to evaluate the intent of a text, classify it according to a set of instructions, assign the result of this classification to the variable and call a specific function based on the variable, passing this variable to the function as an argument


# Terminology

 - **NeuroLang** â€” Neural network programming language specification. Refers to a set of specifications, prompts, guides and instructions to achieve complex computational systems **imagined** by Natural-Language Processing neural network models, such as **ChatGPT**

 - **Semantic Neuroprogramming** â€” Programming paradigm that operates with "imaginary" states and systems. This paradigm refers to the process of creating computational environments inside the **imagination** of a neural network model and combining different prompts and models into complex systems that are programmed by conveying *meaning* or *intent* (the semantics), rather than a specific set of instructions that could be translated to machine-language
 
 - **Neural Virtual Machine** (**NVM**) or **Imagination** â€” Refers to the run-time environment existing withing the **NeuroLang** program (a prompt) that is represented by a statistical model of **token** distribution withing the **NeuroLang**'s code

- **Compiler** â€” Refers to the **core prompt** that initializes the **NVM** environment within the neural network model

- **Code** â€” Refers to the actual **NeuroLang** program. This is a set of instructions that will be evaluated by the **NVM**. **NeuroLang** code is a prompt, written in accordance to the **NeuroLang** specification intended for processing by the Natural Language neural network model in combination with the **Compiler** prompt. **NeuroLang code** is written and distributed in a regular text file with the **.nl** extension.
